* The lecture is about Logistic regression
* What is the main purpose of **logistic regression**?
 - It is used in statistical software to understand the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic regression equation. 
 - This type of analysis can help you predict the likelihood of an event happening or a choice being made


## Difference Between Independent and Dependent Variables in Machine Learning
* Independent variables (also referred to as Features) are the input for a process that is being analyzes. 
* Dependent variables are the output of the process (0s and 1s)
* **feature vector** describes dependent values

## Sentiment analysis:
* Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information
